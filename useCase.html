Flying: The drone must fly using four propellers attached to the body so it can move and navigate the area with ease. 
Landing: The drone must be able to land, this will be accomplished by attaching landing gear to the drone so it does not get damaged when landing.
Grabbing: The drone will be able to grab and carry certain objects, this will be acheived by using tension sensors and a claw with enough strength to support the object, this will be important for when the drone must carry and drop an item of choice.
Alarm: The drone will make a noise when it gets close in proximity with an object in its path, this can be acheived using a small speaker and a sensor so it can alert the user when it's about to hit something, this will be important so the drone is less likely to crash and be damaged because of poor perception.
